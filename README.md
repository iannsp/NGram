# Ngram is life

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/iannsp/NGram.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/iannsp/NGram)

This is a naive ngram implementation with some tools together.

You can select build your ngram over letters or words, using:

- Frequency
  - Letter
  - Word

And you can process

- Text input.
- Black list
- Parse that HTML. Please, be kind with that naive regex.
- Text sanitization.
